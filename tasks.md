# Layout Engine

## Context

The goal is to build a layout engine/builder POC in pure typescript.
We will make prototypes or pocs that can be tested on users, and we will use feedback to decided which look, feel and features to go for.

## Task

### Make 3 testable demos
Up until now, we have only had one POC on the page. Now we want to split it into 3 different POCs, but all accessible from the same page. We can use tabs or something.
The first demo should be the one we currently display by default, with reflow turned on.

The second demo will simply be the same as the first, but without re-flow turned on.

For the third, we want to come up with an even simpler and more basic approach to layout building.
It can sacrifice flexibility for simplicity. Please make a suggestion here.

All 3 demos should have a place to display the tasks. We will show pictures of layout that should be built, and they should be them in each demo
